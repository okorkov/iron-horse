      <p className='about-text-hello'>Hello!</p>
      <p className="about-text">Thanks for stopping by! We are a small, full service, family-owned business based in Fairfax, California and we specialize in custom, reclaimed wood projects from sustainable, local sources. It is a blessing to live in Northern California, with such a wide variety of species. We also specialize in esoteric species from around the world. All of our wood is one hundred percent reclaimed, and handpicked by our specialists; only twenty percent making the cut. Eighty percent of our projects are custom; created to the client's specification, and completely tailored to your liking! We always have a nice, rotating inventory as well if you would like to do your own project. We are a full-service wood mill, and offer planing, sanding, and milling services; collaberating with a local Master Metalsmith if needed. Feel free to reach out, and let's talk about your next project!</p>
